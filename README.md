# Foreseeing the Dark: Machine Learning for Early Power Outage Detection

## Introduction

Welcome to the Power Outages Project! This website provides an overview of our project, aiming to make the findings accessible to a broad audience, including classmates, friends, family, recruiters, and random internet strangers. Here, we present the key elements of our analysis, focusing on understanding the leading indicators of power outages and exploring the potential to develop an early warning system.

## Understanding the Data

The dataset used for this project is the Power Outages dataset, which contains detailed information about various power outage events. Below are the key columns that are relevant to our analysis:

## Project Question

**What are the leading indicators of power outages, and can we build an early warning system to detect potential outages?**

## Importance of the Question

Developing an early warning system for power outages is crucial for several reasons:

- **Preparedness and Response**: Helps utility companies and emergency services prepare for and respond more effectively to impending outages.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Demonstrates the ability to handle and analyze data in real-time, which is crucial for practical applications.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying rare and unusual events shows proficiency in anomaly detection, a valuable skill in machine learning.
- **Practical Impact**: An early warning system has immediate practical applications, providing significant value to stakeholders by potentially preventing outages or mitigating their impact.

By investigating this question and developing an early warning system, we aim to create a practical solution that can help mitigate the effects of power outages and improve the resilience of power infrastructure.

## Dataset Info

- **OUTAGE.START**: The start time of the power outage.
- **OUTAGE.END**: The end time of the power outage.
- **CAUSE.CATEGORY**: The category of the cause of the power outage (e.g., weather, equipment failure).
- **CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL**: Detailed description of the cause.
- **OUTAGE.DURATION**: Duration of the outage in minutes.
- **CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED**: Number of customers affected by the outage.
- **ZIP.CODE**: The ZIP code where the outage occurred.
- **DATE.EVENT**: The date of the power outage event.
- **CLIMATE.CATEGORY**: The climate category (e.g., humid, arid) of the area affected.
- **TEMPERATURE**: Temperature at the time of the outage.
- **PRECIPITATION**: Precipitation level at the time of the outage.

The dataset contains a total of 1540 rows and 57 columns, providing a comprehensive view of the factors involved in power outages.
